                This license agreement (this “Agreement” ) sets out the terms
                relating to the grant of a license in certain intellectual
                property in Degen Forest NFTs (&ldquo;Degen Forest Early
                APES&rdquo; and &ldquo;Degen Forest&rdquo;).
                <br />
                <br />
                Degen Forest NFTs is a collection of 10,000 digital collectible
                tokens using the [ERC-721] token standard, which is more
                commonly known as non-fungible tokens (&ldquo;Degen Forest
                NFTs&rdquo;). Degen Forest NFTs have been minted via a smart
                contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain at address&nbsp;

              <p className="text-lg font-medium text-neutral-400">
                Degen Forest NFTs contain metadata that are associated with
                digital art created by the Creator (as defined below) (the
                “Artwork”). For the purposes of this Agreement, the “Licensed
                NFT Artwork” refers to the Artwork (in its entirety)
                specifically, directly, and identifiably associated with the
                Degen Forest NFT owned by you in totality and not any individual
                component of the Artwork. This Agreement, which contains legally
                binding provisions, is initially entered into between:
                <br />
                <br />
                Degen Forest DAO LLC, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization
                (DAO) incorporated in the United States under the laws of the
                State of Wyoming (“Creator”); and
                <br />
                the individual or entity who is the recorded owner of Degen
                Forest NFTs and who has expressly accepted the terms of this
                Agreement by inserting their electronic signature below (“you”).
                <br />
                Purchasing a non-fungible token does not automatically grant you
                any intellectual property rights or licenses to any artwork
                depicted by the non-fungible token.
                <br />
                <br />
                Accordingly, you agree to enter into this Agreement in order to
                be granted the right to use the Licensed NFT Artwork.
                Individuals and entities who subsequently become owners of Degen
                Forest NFTs using a secondary marketplace that supports creator
                fees may enter into this Agreement by inserting their electronic
                signature below, subject to the verification of ownership of one
                or more Degen Forest NFTs through a process specified by the
                Creator in its sole discretion.WHEREAS:
                <br />
                <br />
                The Smart Contract maintains a record of which digital wallet is
                the owner of a specific Degen Forest NFT. Accordingly, when you
                purchase a Degen Forest NFT on a secondary marketplace or
                receive a Degen Forest NFT by way of a transfer, your ownership
                of that specific Degen Forest NFT is recorded by the Smart
                Contract. Holding a Degen Forest NFT grants you the
                non-exclusive right to hold, sell, transfer and carry out
                blockchain transactions involving that Degen Forest NFT (“Your
                Degen Forest NFT”).
                <br />
                <br />
                The Creator retains absolute ownership of all intellectual
                property rights, title and interest in the Artwork of the Degen
                Forest NFTs, including but not limited to copyrights,
                trademarks, goodwill, and other intellectual property rights.
                <br />
                <br />
                You are granted a license on the terms set out in this Agreement
                to use the Licensed NFT Artwork for as long as you own the
                relevant Degen Forest NFT. As between you and the Creator, you
                own all rights, title and interest in and to any modifications,
                revisions, adaptations or transformations based upon Your Degen
                Forest NFT during the Term (as defined below) (“Derivative
                Works”), provided that (i) the Creator retains the ownership of
                all intellectual property rights in the Licensed NFT Artwork; or
                (ii) your use of any Derivative Works during and after the Term
                is subject to the terms of the Licence (as defined below).
                <br />
                You and the Creator agree as follows:
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>License.</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                Subject to the terms of this Agreement and provided that you
                have acquired Your Degen Forest NFT lawfully, the Creator hereby
                grants to you during the Term (as defined below) a
                non-exclusive, non-transferable, sublicensable, universe-wide,
                royalty-free license to use the Licensed NFT Artwork in any and
                all formats and media, by any and all technologies and means of
                delivery, for any and all purposes whatsoever, including the
                commercialization (without limit), reproduction, distribution,
                preparation of the Derivative Works, public display, and
                otherwise use and exploit the Licensed NFT Artwork (the
                “Licence”).
                <br />
                <br />
                Except as expressly provided herein, ownership of a Degen Forest
                NFT and the Licence are not separable in any way. You may not
                engage in any transaction or activity that purports to decouple
                the Licence from Your Degen Forest NFT.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Licence is subject to, and conditional upon your continued
                compliance with, the following restrictions and qualifications:
                <br />
                <br />
                The Licence extends only to the Licensed NFT Artwork. Therefore,
                while the Licence allows you to create and exploit the
                Derivative Works, the Licence does not grant you rights in any
                individual element (such as the features, attributes,
                properties, or traits) of Your Degen Forest NFT or the Licensed
                NFT Artwork or a license to exploit any individual element
                separate and apart from Your Degen Forest NFT (such as the
                features, attributes, properties, traits and other elements of
                other Degen Forest NFTs).
                <br />
                <br />
                The Licence does not grant you any rights in or to any trade
                names, logos, brands, or trademarks of the Creator or any of its
                affiliates (“Creator Brand IP Rights”), all of which are
                expressly reserved to the Creator and its respective affiliates.
                This means that to the extent that the Licensed NFT Artwork
                contains any Creator Brand IP Rights, you will need to blur or
                edit out such Creator Brand IP Rights prior to any use of the
                Licensed NFT Artwork unless you receive additional written
                permission from the Creator. You hereby agree that any Creator
                Brand IP Rights you purport to acquire, together with any
                associated goodwill, shall automatically, immediately, and at
                your expense be assigned to the Creator or an affiliate
                designated by the Creator.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Licence does not grant you any rights to use the business
                name of “Degen Forest“ or any other business name of the Creator
                and its affiliates, all of which are exclusively reserved to the
                Creator and its affiliates. The Licence does not grant you any
                right to represent yourself as being associated with the Creator
                or any of its affiliates in any capacity. Specifically, nothing
                contained in this Agreement will be construed as creating any
                agency, partnership, joint venture, or other form of joint
                enterprise, employment, or fiduciary relationship between you
                and the Creator, and neither you nor the Creator will have the
                authority to contract for or bind the other in any manner
                whatsoever.
                <br />
                You may not use the Licensed NFT Artwork (i) on any physical or
                digital tobacco, pharmaceutical or regulated product; (ii) on
                any physical or digital weapons or other items which may
                represent or are associated with war (iii) in a manner that
                expresses hate or prejudice or encourages violence towards a
                person or group based on membership in a protected class, such
                as race, religion, gender, orientation, or disability; or (iv)
                any manner which would bring the Creator into disrepute.
                <br />
                <br />
                You may not use the Licensed NFT Artwork in a manner that
                violates any applicable law.
                <br />
                <br />
                While your right to use the Licensed NFT Artwork under the
                Licence is royalty-free, you agree to pay a creator fee
                (otherwise known as a resale royalty) when you buy or sell the
                Degen Forest NFTs. The Creator has selected 9% as the percentage
                of creator fees. These creator fees are deducted each time a
                Degen Forest NFT is sold on a secondary marketplace that
                supports such creator fees. You undertake not to transfer your
                ownership in any of Your Degen Forest NFTs in any manner which
                would purposefully result in you failing to pay the creator fees
                in full. For the avoidance of doubt, you are not prohibited from
                gifting Your Degen Forest NFTs to another person or making a
                transfer that is not for the purpose of circumventing the
                payment of creator fees.
                <br />
                <br />
                As a continuing condition of receiving the rights under this
                Licence, you agree to the collection and payment of creator fees
                to the Creator when you buy and sell the NFT. You agree that you
                will not use Your Degen Forest NFTs and the Licensed NFT Artwork
                in any way that circumvents the payment of creator fees in the
                sale of Your Degen Forest NFTs. You agree that you will not
                offer to sell or sell Your Degen Forest NFTs on any website,
                app, intermediary, marketplace, platform, or exchange
                (collectively, “marketplace”) that does not collect or enforce
                creator fees or that makes creator fees optional or adopts a
                so-called “zero royalty” approach. You agree that offering to
                sell or selling Your Degen Forest NFTs on a marketplace that
                does not collect or enforce creator fees or makes creator fees
                optional, or conducting a sale by any other manner (such as
                peer-to-peer transactions) that circumvents the payment of
                creator fees, is not authorized by this Licence and constitutes
                a breach of this Licence. Additionally, if you sell Your Degen
                Forest NFTs on a marketplace that does not collect the creator
                fees, you agree to pay the amount of creator fees to the
                Creator.
                <br />
                <br />
                Your obligation to pay creator fees in the sale of Your Degen
                Forest NFTs shall expire when the copyright term to the Artwork
                expires.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Licence does not permit you to (i) mint another non-fungible
                token using the Licensed NFT Artwork; (ii) use the Licensed NFT
                Artwork in a manner that competes with the Creator; or (iii) in
                audiovisual media.
                <br />
                <br />
                All rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved
                by the Creator.
                <br />
                Release
                <br />
                <br />
                The Creator acknowledges that not every owner of a Degen Forest
                NFT will be aware of the need to enter into a license agreement
                with the Creator upon the acquisition of a Degen Forest NFT.
                Accordingly, by entering into this Agreement, the Creator hereby
                releases you from all liability and obligations and irrevocably
                waives its right to make a claim against you in respect of any
                infringement of Creator Brand IP Rights in respect of the
                Licensed NFT Artwork, subject to the following conditions:
                <br />
                <br />
                your use of the Licensed NFT Artwork must not have breached any
                term of this Agreement. In other words, the Creator will treat
                you as if you entered into this Agreement upon you legally
                acquiring Your Degen Forest NFT; and
                <br />
                <br />
                the Creator’s release and waiver shall only apply in respect of
                the period commencing from the date you acquire Your Degen
                Forest NFT lawfully and ending immediately upon your transfer of
                Your Degen Forest NFT to another person.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Creator agrees to carry out all such acts to give effect to
                the release and waiver set out in this Clause 2. Specifically,
                if the release set out in Clause 2 is insufficient under any
                laws applicable to you, the Creator shall execute in your favour
                a separate document giving effect to the release and waiver.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Representations and warranties.</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                Each party represents and warrants to the other that it has the
                full right, power, and authority to enter into, perform, and

                You hereby represent and warrant to the Creator that:

                you lawfully acquired Your Degen Forest NFT;
                <br />
                you paid the creator fees when acquiring Your Degen Forest NFT;

                you are the sole and absolute owner of the private keys to the

                person(s), that you have the authority to enter into this
                Agreement on the behalf of such other person(s);
                <br />
                you will not use the Licensed NFT Artwork in any manner that is
                defamatory, obscene, or otherwise unlawful;

                you will not use the Licensed NFT Artwork in any manner that is

                you will not use the Licensed NFT Artwork in any manner that is
                detrimental to the Creator or its affiliates;

                you will not carry out any act to sell or otherwise dispose of
                your ownership of Your Degen Forest NFT in a manner that

                you are not, and will not, knowingly execute a transaction

                <br />
                <br />
                As a separate obligation to that in Clause 4.1, you will defend,
                indemnify, and hold the Creator, its licensors, affiliates,
                representatives, and service providers, and each of them, and
                all of their respective officers, directors, employees, and
                agents (the &ldquo;Indemnified Parties&ldquo;) harmless from and
                against any and all claims, damages, losses, investigations,
                liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, settlements, interest,
                and other similar results or occurrences (including
                attorneys&apos; fees) that directly or indirectly arise from, or
                are related to or in connection with, any claim, suit, action,
                demand, or proceeding or other similar occurrence, process, or
                activity that is initiated, made, brought, or financed by a
                third party (including any person who accesses or transacts
                using any Degen Forest NFTs or artwork associated with Degen
                Forest, whether or not such person personally purchased a Degen
                Forest NFT) against the Indemnified Parties, or on account of
                the investigation, defence, or settlement thereof, arising out
                of related to, or in connection with: (a) your access to or use
                of any NFT marketplace or third-party services or products; (b)
                your breach or alleged breach of this Agreement; (c) your
                exercise or attempted exercise of the Licence; or (d) your
                actual or alleged violation of applicable law. Counsel to be
                used in the defense of such claim must be approved by the
                Creator in writing prior to the retention of such counsel and,
                upon our request, you will allow us to participate in the
                defense of any such claims. You will not enter into any
                settlement or compromise of any claim or litigation or that
                includes an admission of liability without the Creator&apos;s
                prior written consent.
                <br />
                <br />
                Each Degen Forest NFT is an intangible digital asset that exists
                only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the
                Ethereum blockchain. Any transfer of ownership that might occur
                in any unique digital asset occurs on the decentralized ledger
                within the Ethereum blockchain, which the Creator does not
                control.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Creator will not be responsible or liable to the owner for
                any loss in connection with any Degen Forest NFT or the Licensed
                NFT Artwork and takes no responsibility for, and will not be
                liable to the owner for, any use of or inability to use any
                Degen Forest NFT or the Licensed NFT Artwork for any reason.
                <br />
                <br />
                There are numerous risks associated with blockchain technology
                and the Degen Forest NFTs. You should familiarize yourself with
                these risks and agree to assume these risks by owning a Degen
                Forest NFT.
                <br />
                To the maximum extent permitted by law, no Indemnified Party
                will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary, or
                consequential damages, or damages for lost profits, lost
                revenues, lost savings, lost business opportunity, loss of data
                or goodwill, service interruption, computer damage, or system
                failure, or the cost of substitute services of any kind arising
                out of or in connection with these terms or from the use of or
                inability to use or interact with any Degen Forest NFT or the
                Licensed NFT Artwork, whether based on warranty, contract, tort
                (including negligence), product liability, or any other legal
                theory, and whether or not the Creator or its service providers
                have been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a
                limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its
                essential purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
                will any Indemnified Party&apos;s cumulative liability hereunder
                from all causes of action and all theories of liability exceed
                the price paid for Your Degen Forest NFTs.

                  Term and Termination.
                </b>
                <br />
                <br />
                This Agreement is effective commencing from the date that you
                enter into this Agreement and shall automatically expire
                immediately after your disposal (including by way of sale or
                transfer) of Your Degen Forest NFT (as recorded by the Smart
                Contract) (“Term”).
                <br />
                <br />
                Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement: (a) if you
                have complied with the conditions of the Licence, including the
                obligation to the payment of creator royalties, the 5 subsequent
                acquirers of Your Degen Forest NFT shall receive the same rights
                under this Agreement to the extent permitted under applicable
                law; (b) if you have not complied with the conditions of the
                Licence, all rights licensed under this Agreement will revert to
                the Creator and you will be prohibited from any further use of
                the Licensed NFT Artwork; (c) you may retain any tangible
                property using the Licensed NFT Artwork for personal use only;
                and (d) all sublicenses that have been granted by you shall
                automatically and immediately terminate. If, during the Term,
                you create and make available to the public a Derivative Work,
                you may continue to use and exploit that Derivative Work in
                accordance with this Agreement after the Term; provided however
                that: (i) you will be responsible for any obligations or
                liabilities arising from your continued use of the Derivative
                Work after the Term; and (ii) this privilege does not allow you
                to use the Licensed NFT Artwork to create any new works or
                materials after the Term.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Non-Compliance with this Agreement.</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                If you materially breach any term of this Agreement, or if the
                Creator discovers that you acquired Your Degen Forest NFT(s)
                unlawfully or you acquired Your Degen Forest NFT(s) and failed
                to pay creator fees, the Creator may seek appropriate measures
                and remedies, including but not limited to any one or more of
                the following:
                <br />
                <br />
                terminating this Agreement with immediate effect, provided that
                the Creator may allow you to cure such breach within a specified
                timeframe;
                <br />
                <br />
                restricting you from enjoying or participating in any future
                benefit or gathering of the community for Your Degen Forest NFTs
                (including, without limitation, airdrops and events conducted
                for the community), although, for the avoidance of doubt, the
                Creator has no obligation to provide any future benefit or
                gathering to the community or you;
                <br />
                <br />
                requiring a marketplace to remove or disable access to the
                infringing uses of the Licensed NFT Artwork displayed on a
                marketplace, platform or other Internet service provider by way
                of a Digital Millennium Copyright Act notice or a takedown
                notice in accordance with applicable copyright or other laws.
                <br />
                Miscellaneous.
                <br />
                Recognised Blockchain. The Licence applies only to the Degen
                Forest NFTs on the blockchain that the Creator, in its sole
                discretion, may designate, which designation shall apply
                retroactively. Thus, for example, if a fork or other event
                purports to result in duplicate Degen Forest NFTs, only the
                Degen Forest NFTs recorded on the blockchain designated by the
                Creator will be eligible to receive the benefit of the License.
                Any license purportedly granted hereunder to the owner of a
                non-fungible token recorded on a blockchain not designated by
                the Creator is void ab initio.
                <br />
                <br />
                Assignment. This Agreement is personal to you. Unless otherwise
                provided in this Agreement, you may not assign or otherwise
                transfer any of its rights, delegate, or otherwise transfer any
                of its obligations or performance, under this Agreement. Any
                purported assignment, delegation, or transfer in violation of
                this Clause is void. The Creator may freely assign or otherwise
                transfer all or any of its rights, or delegate or otherwise
                transfer all or any of its obligations or performance, under
                this Agreement. This Agreement is binding on and inures to the
                benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted
                successors and assigns.
                <br />
                <br />
                Waiver. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof
                will be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and
                signed by the party so waiving. No waiver by any party 6 will
                operate or be construed as a waiver of any failure, breach, or
                default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether
                of a similar or different character, and whether occurring
                before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in
                exercising, any right, remedy, power, or privilege arising from
                this Agreement will operate or be construed as a waiver thereof;
                nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
                power, or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further
                exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy,
                power, or privilege.
                <br />
                <br />
                Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
                in accordance with the laws of the State of Wyoming, without
                regard to its principles on the conflicts of laws.
                <br />
                <br />
                Dispute Resolution. Each party to this Agreement hereby
                irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
                property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any Wyoming State
                court or federal court of the United States of America, and any
                appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding
                arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition
                or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
                hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
                respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
                determined in such Wyoming State or, to the extent permitted by
                law, in such federal court.
                <br />
                <br />
                Entire Agreement, Severance. This Agreement, including and
                together with any related attachments, is the sole and entire
                agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter
                herein and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
                understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties,
                whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter. If any
                term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or
                unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality,
                or unenforceability will not affect any other term or provision
                of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such
                term or provision in any other jurisdiction.
                <br />
                <br />
                Amendment. Any amendments of this Agreement must be submitted to
                all holders the Degen Forest NFTs for voting. An amendment will
                only be effective upon the approval of (1) the Creator; and (2)
                the majority of the holders of the Degen Forest NFT that
                participate in such voting process. For the purposes of voting
                among the majority of the holders, one (1) Degen Forest NFT
                shall be entitled to one (1) vote.
